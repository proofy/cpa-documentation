# German Corona Warn App (CPA)
## Backend Infrastructure Architecture Overview

The file ``backend-infrastructure-architecture.pdf`` complements the "CPA Solution Architecture" document. It is intended as a technical overview document of Corona Warn App (CPA) and its underlying infrastructure and network.

This description of the **cwa backend infrastructure architecture** is not published as MD file, because it is not intended to be developed together with the community. Whoever takes the sources and sets up their own "corona warn app" may use another backend structure. Nevertheless, it might be helpful to know how the current project is implemented in a data center. Therefore, we publish this document as a pdf file.
